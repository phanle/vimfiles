# The Vim Configuration. [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/luan/vimfiles.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/luan/vimfiles)

If you're trying to use this config checkout this [cheat sheet](https://github.com/luan/vimfiles/wiki/Luan's-Vim-Cheat-Sheet).

## Installation

1. `git clone http://github.com/phanle/vimfiles.git ~/.vim`
1. `~/.vim/install` [more...](#install-script)
1. Enjoy

## Recommended Setup (OSX/Linux)

### Faster and better autocomplete

**OSX**

```bash
brew reinstall vim --with-lua
brew reinstall macvim --with-lua
```

**Linux**

```bash
sudo apt-get install vim-nox
```

### ctags

**OSX**

```bash
brew uninstall ctags
brew tap kopischke/ctags
brew install ctags-fishman --HEAD
```

**Linux**

*exuberant-ctags* from your OS is generally enough for most things, but if you want more CSS, ruby and other goodnesses you will need to manually compile and replace your ctags installation with: https://github.com/fishman/ctags

## Plugin Installation / Requirements

I may make this more verbose later, but for now, here's a list of plugins that require further installation:

 * [Fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive) Requires Git to be installed.
 * [ag.vim](https://github.com/rking/ag.vim) Requires [ag](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) to be installed.
 * [ack.vim](https://github.com/mileszs/ack.vim) Requires [ack](http://betterthangrep.com/) to be installed.
 * [tagbar](https://github.com/majutsushi/tagbar) Requires [exuberant-ctags](https://github.com/fishman/ctags)

## Install Script

The directory contains a bash script named `install`. `install` will create your local override files (`.vimrc.loca.before` and `.vimrc.local`), symlink `.vimrc` and `.gvimrc`.
It will also install `golang`'s tools if you have golang on your `$PATH`.

## Notes
=======
```
" will save automatically when exiting the buffer
" 0 or 1, defaults 0
let g:autosave = 1
```

## Plugin Installation / Requirements

Be sure to always edit the vimrc using `,vi`, which opens the vimrc in the .vim folder. Vim has a nasty habit of overriding symlinks.
